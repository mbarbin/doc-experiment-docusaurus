Welcome! I've embarked on an exciting journey to explore how Docusaurus can be used to document OCaml projects, while seamlessly integrating with OCaml's dedicated tools like dune, odoc, and ocaml-mdx.

This exploration aims to culminate in a template or a simple example that showcases the dynamic capabilities of combining these tools. It's a work in progress, and I'm eager to dive deeper into the features, seeking to enrich this experiment with community feedback and collaboration.

I'm thrilled to have initiated this repository, creating a space for incremental progress and sharing insights with fellow Docusaurus and OCaml enthusiasts.

I invite you to join this journey. Whether you have suggestions, questions, or just want to chat about Docusaurus and OCaml, please feel free to reach out. Open an issue or spark a conversation in the Discussions space on our GitHub page. Let's explore the possibilities together!
