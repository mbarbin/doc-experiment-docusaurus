Welcome to this experiment with documentation tools! In this project, we're exploring how Docusaurus can be used to document OCaml projects, while seamlessly integrating with OCaml's dedicated tools like dune, odoc, and ocaml-mdx.

We envision this project as a template and example for the OCaml community, demonstrating the power and flexibility of combining these tools. We welcome PRs, encourage you to try this setup in your projects, and invite you to share your experiences and suggestions with us. Let's innovate documentation together!

## Status

This repo is currently experimental and under construction. It's a work in progress, and I'm eager to dive deeper into the features, seeking to enrich this experiment with community feedback and collaboration.

## Acknowledgements

The essence of the doc-experiment project lies in creating a setup that makes uses of the capabilities of several remarkable tools. It's a symphony where each tool plays a crucial role, contributing to a seamless documentation experience for OCaml projects. The real magic, however, resides in the hard work, dedication, and innovation embedded within each of these tools. We are immensely thankful for the amazing features these tools offer and even more so to the myriad of contributors behind them.

We extend our deepest gratitude to the following projects and their contributors:

- [ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml): For the OCaml programming language, which is at the heart of our documentation journey.
- [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune): For the Dune build system, enabling us to compile our OCaml projects with ease.
- [setup-ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml): For simplifying the setup of OCaml environments in our CI workflows.
- [odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc): For the odoc tool, which generates styled HTML documentation from OCaml packages.
- [ocaml-mdx](https://github.com/realworldocaml/mdx): For allowing us to execute code blocks within our markdown files, ensuring our documentation is always up to date.
- [sherlodoc](https://github.com/art-w/sherlodoc): For its innovative approach to searching OCaml documentation.
- [docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus): For providing a platform to bring all our documentation together in a user-friendly and accessible manner.

In addition to this, we also want to acknowledge the broader community and various other resources that are supporting us in more open-ended ways. Their contributions, though not always directly linked to the core functionality of our project, have significantly enriched our journey and the overall project outcome.

- [OpenArt AI](https://openart.ai): With which we generated the logo for our project.

The collective effort of all these tools, resources, and their communities has been instrumental in bringing the doc-experiment project to life. We are grateful for their existence and the communities that support them.
