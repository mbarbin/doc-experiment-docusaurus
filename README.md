Welcome to this experiment with documentation tools! In this project, we're exploring how Docusaurus can be used to document OCaml projects, while seamlessly integrating with OCaml's dedicated tools like dune, odoc, and ocaml-mdx.

We envision this project as a template and example for the OCaml community, demonstrating the power and flexibility of combining these tools. We welcome PRs, encourage you to try this setup in your projects, and invite you to share your experiences and suggestions with us. Let's innovate documentation together!

## Status

This repo is currently experimental and under construction. It's a work in progress, and I'm eager to dive deeper into the features, seeking to enrich this experiment with community feedback and collaboration.
